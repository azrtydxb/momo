Leave the `Key:` lines alone — they are what ties an answer to its question.

## Q1: [decision] decisions.md

Key: 0a9061acfb22
Question: Stories with honestly unticked criteria before v0.1.0

- Carry 094, 097, 098, 123, 124 and 148 out of sprint 2 with their reason recorded (pre-existing code so no red state; SQLite/MySQL not built yet; CLI commands rebase/lint/rollback/new not built); they stay open in the backlog and the sprint can close (recommended)
- Tick the "failed before the implementation" criteria with a note that mutation runs stand in for the red state, close 094, 097, 124 and 148; carry 098 and 123
- Leave all of them open in sprint 2 and decide after the release

Decision (2026-11-06): carry with reasons; 094, 097, 098, 123, 124 and 148 go back to the backlog with the reason recorded, nothing ticked without evidence.

Answer: Carry with reasons (user, AskUserQuestion 2026-11-06): 094, 097, 098, 123, 124 and 148 go back to the backlog with the reason recorded; nothing ticked without evidence.
