Answer each one by writing a line beginning `Answer: ` under it, then
hand the file back with `procoder ask --file .procoder/ask/QA.md`.
Leave the `Key:` lines alone — they are what ties an answer to its question.

## Q1: [decision] decisions.md

Key: 506a3307210c
Question: Squash-merge PR #5 into main

- Squash-merge PR #5 now, delete the remote sprint-2 branch afterwards only if you want sprint-2 retired, then check that release-please's PR #3 shows 0.1.0 (recommended)
- Wait for a human review first
- Do not merge yet

Decision (2026-11-06): squash-merge PR #5 now; keep sprint-2 as the working branch; check release-please PR #3 before tagging.

Answer: Squash-merge now (user, AskUserQuestion 2026-11-06): merged as c744711; sprint-2 kept and reset onto main.
