## Recreate the momo PgBouncer test container with the new pgbouncer.ini (story 065)

- Recreate now: `docker compose -f internal/testdb/compose.yaml up -d --force-recreate pgbouncer`, then re-run the PgBouncer integration tests against the new config (max_prepared_statements = 0, plain auth, userlist).
- Leave the running container as is; the new config is applied the next time the test database is brought up with `make db-up`.

Decision (2026-11-05): recreate now. Mounting the ini failed (Docker Desktop cannot share /Volumes/DATA), so the same settings are applied through the image environment; the container was recreated with them.

## Isolate the PgBouncer suite run in a scratch database (story 136 / 065)

The edoburu PgBouncer image cannot track `search_path` (no env variable for `track_extra_parameters`, and mounting an ini fails on this host and in CI), so pooled backends keep stale per-test schemas and `suite.RunAll` through the pooler is red.

- Route every database through the pooler (env `DB_HOST`/`DB_USER`/`DB_PASSWORD` without a database name gives a `* =` entry) in compose and CI, recreate Momo's pgbouncer container once more, and run the pooled suite in a per-run scratch database `momo_bnc_<hex>` that is dropped afterwards.
- Leave the pooler as is and schema-qualify every table name in the shared suite.
- Leave phase 2 red and carry the S-30 criterion of story 065.

Decision (2026-11-05): scratch database per run.
