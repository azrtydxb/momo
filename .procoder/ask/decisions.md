## Recreate the momo PgBouncer test container with the new pgbouncer.ini (story 065)

- Recreate now: `docker compose -f internal/testdb/compose.yaml up -d --force-recreate pgbouncer`, then re-run the PgBouncer integration tests against the new config (max_prepared_statements = 0, plain auth, userlist).
- Leave the running container as is; the new config is applied the next time the test database is brought up with `make db-up`.

Decision (2026-11-05): recreate now. Mounting the ini failed (Docker Desktop cannot share /Volumes/DATA), so the same settings are applied through the image environment; the container was recreated with them.
